1. NepseIndex
Description:

The NepseIndex is likely a representation of a stock index or an individual stock's daily closing prices.
Relevance to Stock Price Prediction:

This column represents the actual historical prices of the stock or index. It's essential as the primary data series you're trying to predict. By analyzing the past values of the NepseIndex, you can model its trend, seasonal patterns, and other behaviors to forecast future prices.
Usage in Prediction:

Historical Prices: Use past price data to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies.
Technical Analysis: Serve as the basis for calculating various technical indicators (e.g., Moving Averages, RSI) which are used in many trading strategies.
2. Moving Average (e.g., 10-Day EMA, 12-Day EMA, 26-Day EMA)
Description:

Moving Averages smooth out price data to help identify trends over specific periods. The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) places more weight on recent prices, making it more responsive to new information.
Relevance to Stock Price Prediction:

Moving averages are fundamental in technical analysis as they help filter out the "noise" from random short-term price fluctuations. They help traders and models identify the direction of the trend more clearly.
Usage in Prediction:

Trend Identification: Determine if the market is in an uptrend, downtrend, or sideways.
Crossover Strategies: The interaction (crossing) between short-term (e.g., 10-Day EMA) and long-term (e.g., 26-Day EMA) moving averages is often used to generate buy/sell signals.
Feature in Machine Learning: Moving averages can be directly used as features in a predictive model to help capture trend-based behavior.
3. Relative Strength Index (RSI)
Description:

The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It ranges from 0 to 100 and indicates overbought or oversold conditions.
Relevance to Stock Price Prediction:

RSI helps identify the momentum of price movements and potential reversal points. High RSI values suggest that the stock might be overbought and due for a price correction, while low values indicate it might be oversold and poised for a rebound.
Usage in Prediction:

Overbought/Oversold Conditions: Values above 70 suggest overbought conditions (potential for price drop), while values below 30 suggest oversold conditions (potential for price rise).
Divergence Analysis: Divergences between RSI and price movements can signal upcoming reversals.
Feature Engineering: RSI can be used as an input feature to capture momentum and potential reversal signals in machine learning models.
4. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
Description:

MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages (typically the 12-day and 26-day EMAs). It consists of the MACD line and a signal line (usually a 9-day EMA of the MACD line).
Relevance to Stock Price Prediction:

MACD is used to identify changes in the strength, direction, momentum, and duration of a trend. It helps traders and models identify bullish and bearish momentum in the stock's price.
Usage in Prediction:

Signal Line Crossovers: When the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it suggests bullish momentum; crossing below suggests bearish momentum.
Histogram: The distance between the MACD line and the signal line can be plotted as a histogram to visualize momentum strength and direction.
Feature in Models: MACD values and their changes can be used to predict future price movements, particularly in momentum-based trading strategies.
5. Average True Range (ATR)
Description:

The ATR measures market volatility by decomposing the entire range of an asset price for that period. It is the average of true ranges over a specified period (usually 14 days).
Relevance to Stock Price Prediction:

ATR is essential for understanding the volatility of a stock. Volatile stocks may have larger price swings, which can be crucial for predicting risk and setting stop-loss levels.
Usage in Prediction:

Volatility Indicator: Higher ATR values indicate increased volatility, which could signal larger price movements or uncertainty.
Stop-Loss Adjustments: Traders use ATR to set stop-loss levels, ensuring they accommodate expected price swings.
Feature in Risk Models: ATR can be incorporated into predictive models to account for volatility and risk.
6. Gain and Loss
Description:

Gain and Loss represent the absolute daily gains and losses of the stock price.
Relevance to Stock Price Prediction:

These metrics provide insight into the daily price movements and can help identify volatility and directional bias in stock movements.
Usage in Prediction:

Volatility and Trend Analysis: Understanding the magnitude and frequency of gains and losses helps in assessing stock volatility and potential trends.
Input Features: These can be used in predictive models to capture daily price movement patterns and their contributions to stock volatility.
7. Average Gain and Average Loss
Description:

These represent the average gains and losses over a specific period, often used in calculating the RSI.
Relevance to Stock Price Prediction:

Average gain and loss help to smooth out daily volatility and provide a clearer picture of a stock's performance over time, which is crucial for momentum-based predictions.
Usage in Prediction:

Momentum Indicators: Average gain and loss are components in RSI calculation, which is critical for predicting momentum and potential reversals.
Feature for Models: They can be directly used as features in machine learning models to capture smoothed momentum and trend information.
8. RS (Relative Strength)
Description:

Relative Strength is a ratio of average gain to average loss over a specified period, typically used in the calculation of RSI.
Relevance to Stock Price Prediction:

RS is a key component in the RSI formula, helping to identify the relative strength or weakness of a stock's price over time.
Usage in Prediction:

Indicator of Price Movement Strength: RS values help determine the potential for price changes and can indicate when a stock is moving strongly in a particular direction.
Feature Engineering: RS can be used to derive RSI or as an individual feature to predict stock momentum.
9. TrueRange
Description:

TrueRange is the greatest of the current high minus the current low, the absolute value of the current high minus the previous close, and the absolute value of the current low minus the previous close.
Relevance to Stock Price Prediction:

It provides a more comprehensive measure of a stock's price range and volatility for a single day, including gaps between closing and opening prices.
Usage in Prediction:

Volatility Measure: TrueRange is critical for understanding the full extent of daily price movements, useful for volatility analysis.
Risk Assessment: Helps in assessing potential risks by identifying days with significant price swings, important for setting stops and predicting large moves.
10. AverageTrueRange
Description:

Average True Range (ATR) is the moving average of the True Range over a specified period, typically used to measure volatility.
Relevance to Stock Price Prediction:

ATR provides a smoothed measure of volatility, which is essential for understanding market conditions and predicting potential price swings.
Usage in Prediction:

Feature for Volatility-Based Models: ATR can help predict future price ranges and set appropriate risk measures (like stop-loss orders).
Market Condition Assessment: Helps in determining whether the market is calm or volatile, influencing trading strategies and predictions.
